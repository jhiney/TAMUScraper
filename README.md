# TAMUScraper

The [Texas A&M University Directory](https://services.tamu.edu/directory-search/#basic-search) allows you to search for faculty, staff , and students currently working at Texas A&M. <br/> However, it limits you to  50 results total per search and doesn't allow for the exporting of all the information returned. This scraper allows for searching the TAMU directory and exporting information into a CSV in order to expedite searches, such as needing to see all faculty of a certain position, or all staff of a certain college.
